## Example Execution

When user provides:

- Style: BCG

You would:
1. Use `disruptx_clean_presentation.py` or `tier23_healthcare_presentation.py`
2. Customize with telemedicine focus
3. Apply BCG blue/teal color scheme
4. Generate 3-slide deck with:
   - Slide 1: Problem (healthcare access in tier-2)

   - Slide 3: Impact (metrics, ROI, scaling)

## Remember
- Every pixel should add value
- Less is more for executive audiences
- Data should tell a story
- Visuals should enhance, not distract
- Consistency is professional
- Action titles drive engagement
